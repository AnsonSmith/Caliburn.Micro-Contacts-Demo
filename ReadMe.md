PersonalContactsDemo
============================================



This is a simple demo of Caliburn.Micro. It is a simple port of the Game Library Silverlight app demoed in Bryan Hunter's 
Devlink Session. In order to get a feel for CM I took the Game Library Project and ported it to WPF and converted it to a 
personal contact organizer.
